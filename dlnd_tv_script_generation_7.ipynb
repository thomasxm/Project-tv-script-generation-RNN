    "## **Answer:** \n",
    "### Learning rate: \n",
    "Learing rate can be 0.1, 0.01, 0.0001, 0.00001, etc. Alternatively, apaptive learning rate can be applied as: \n",
    "\n",

    "if(e > 20):\n",
    "    print(\"learning rate in epoch\", e, \"before change:\", optimizer.param_groups[0][\"lr\"])\n",
    "    lr = init_lr * (0.1 ** (e // 20))\n",

    "        param_group['lr'] = lr \n",
    "    print(\"after change:\", optimizer.param_groups[0][\"lr\"])`\n",
    "When training a model, it is often recommended to lower the learning rate as the training progresses. The learning rate can be adjusted as learning rate linear decay, or exponentially decay. \n",
    "\n",
    "### dropout rate: \n",
    "the dropout layer is used to mitigates the overfitting. It can be number between 0 - 1, in general, we can compare the training loss and validation loss if they are further apart during training process (training loss much smaller than val loss), it indicates overfitting of the model. In other words, the model is trying to memorize the data instead of learning it. \n",
    "The dropout rate is 0.3 which is optimal in our case. \n",
    "\n",
    "### batches: \n",
    "The good candidate for batch sizes are: $$1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, \\cdots 256.$$ \n",
    "The mini batchsize, too small the training process is too slow, too large cause too much memory (computationaly taxing) and decreasing of validation and test accuracy. The batch size between $32 - 256$ (range) would be good starting point, in order to test the mini batch size values. (Systematic evaluation of CNN advances on the ImageNet, Mishkin et al, 2016) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation from Udacity: setting batch_size as a power of 2 (128 in your case) is handled efficiently by torch (better so on GPU).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### epochs:\n",
    "Regarding to the epochs, we can set stops the training process once the validation error is stopped decreasing, or it stopped decreasing after 10 to 20 steps, then we call stop the iterations. The technique is called **earlier stopping**. The number of epochs essentially depends on the trend of validation errors. The earlier stopping can be easily implemented manually, or it is built in with Tensorflow, but not Pytorch. \n",
    "\n",
    "I stopped the iteration earlier since I don't have much GPU time left, but in practice, I would expect my final loss to be around 1.0 after 50 epochs.  \n",
    "### hidden layers:\n",
    "The increased hidden layers tends to overfitting the data, which appears as departs of validation loss from training loss. However, we can fix this by adopting regularization techniques such as: Dropout or L2 regularazation, or more data sets. In practice, keep adding the hidden units until the validation loss are getting worse (stopped decreased or increased). In general the number of hidden units can be larger than the number of inputs. \n",
    "2 - 3 would be enough (Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network Architectures\n",
    "for Large Scale Acoustic Modeling)\n",
    "\n",
    "### hidden dimensions: \n",
    "The hidden_dim usually takes common values between 128, 256, 512, etc. We take 512 in this case. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### embedding dimensions: \n",
    "The number of embedding_dim and hidden layers can prevent underfitting, the more the layers the better the accuracy. The typical embedding dimension would be between 200–300 (source: Google). The embedding dimension is set to match the size of the total unique vocab size, which is $1\\%$ of the size of vocab.\n",
    "\n",
    "### sequence lengths: \n",
    "The SL impacts on the datasets's long term dependencies. 30 should be suffice to include a sentence of a person said in TV plot script. I find the longer the sequence length, the faster the convergence speed, but once the sequence length exceeds 30, the initial loss starts to increase.  "
